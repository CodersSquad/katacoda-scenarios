Now that you have cloned the git-based project, it's time to create your Classify User

# Configure your local variables

Before the user creation you need to define some variables in the git local storage

``git config --local classify.fullname "<Your Full Name>"``{{execute no-newline}}

``git config --local classify.github-user <you_github_user>``{{execute no-newline}}

``git config --local classify.school-id <your_school_id>``{{execute no-newline}}


# Create the user
Let's do it, let's create a new Classify user

``make user``{{execute}}
