That's all for submitting your first lab to the Classify API. Below
some last minute tips advices.

- Submit your lab on time, Classify API will not accept late submissions
- Never work on `master` branch
- Always run `make check-submission` to verify that your lab has been properly submitted.
- Never forget the `git push`, it will provide the source code to fetch to the Classify API.

Thanks for running this scenario and have a happy coding day.
